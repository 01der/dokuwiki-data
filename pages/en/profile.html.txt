  *I can offer services which require the combined application of knowledge and experience in the fields of IT, engineering and management, based on a valuable and sustainable 
    *IT experience ( since 1980 ).
    *Expertness and professional work experience in the fields [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation|Instrumentation]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA|Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)]] ( since 1985 ).
    *Experience in implementation and operation of enterprise networks ( since 1993 ).
    *Experience in development and implementation of online media contents ( since 1995 ).
  *My focus is quality assurance, requirements management, process and services design for small and medium companies as well as testing.
  *I am single, nonparous. Since 2010-03-01 I am able and willing to relocate within Germany. I don´t have liabilities to pay. So I am free, open-minded and flexible for engagements to master new tasks and challenges.
  *I am practicing the principle of lifelong learning, for more than 25 years.
  *"Intercultural competence" is important for you, right?! I am second generation migrant from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlesien|Silesia]], already born in Germany. Of course I expect equal opportunities as migrants and refugees of other provenance, by german companies which privilege migrants and refugees, or which are requested to privilege migrants and refugees ( [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action|Affirmative Action]] ), in case of works contracts or engagement. I would like to refer to Christian Wulff, former Federal President of Germany, who expressed on 2010-01-25 in public, that german companies are due to employ more migrants.
