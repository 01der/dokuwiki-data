===== Tips for running a WHITE PINE 2.X CU-SEEEME client =====
Please setup the client according to the table below, the numeric values are for 28.8 Kbps modem connections. For WHITE PINE 2.X clients only (not for 3.X clients): For closing a single video window, be shure not to close it manually, but to close all video windows at one by using the function "Window/Close all" or by pressing the appropriate button with the closed eye at the button line in the main CU-SEEME window!
