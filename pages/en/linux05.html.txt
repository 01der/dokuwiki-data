===== Installation of SUSE Linux 7.1 on Computers with SIS630 / SIS630S / SIS630ST Chipset =====
  *Get the Linux distribution SUSE Linux 7.1 or newer and download the latest Linux kernel ( i.e. 2.4.18 at the time of writing of these instructions ) as tar.gz archive at [[http://www.kernel.org/|Kernel.org]].
  *Prepare your system for Linux installation
    *1 - Switch on your notebook, go to the BIOS setup ( e.g. by pressing <CTRL>,<ALT> and <S> together at the same time when prompted ).
    *2 - Set the video memory by the menu option "Memory / VGA Shared Memory" to 8 MByte ( best choise if Linux is the only operating system ) or 16 MByte ( best choice if you want to play DVDs with Windows, too )
    *3 - Do a harddisk partitioning so that some space on the harddisk is available for a LINUX installation. Make MSDOS boot from harddisk so that Windows is not loaded at boot time of MSDOS, enable access to the CDROM drive for MSDOS:
      *Do it any way you like, e.g. follow the instructions in the SUSE manual or ask a friend.
      *My way deletes all data on the harddisk !

  *Step 1: Boot MSDOS from a floppy disk and repartition the harddisk with the MSDOS command FDISK.EXE. Here is the FDISK.EXE partition table for my 15 GB harddisk = 14402 MByte, which lefts 8998 MByte for Linux:

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
^ Partition ^ Status ^ Typ ^ Bezeichnung ^ MB ^ System ^ Belegung ^
^ C: 1 | A | PRI DOS | HD1 | 4401 | FAT32 | 1% |
^ 2 | | EXT DOS | | 1004 | | 1% |
^ | | | | | | |

  *Step 2: Boot MSDOS from a floppy disk and use the command "FORMAT C: /S/U/V" to format the MSDOS boot partition !
  *Step 3: If you decide to install Windows 95/98/98SE now, you must modify the file "C:\MSDOS.SYS" with a DOS text editor after the installation of Windows: The line "BootGui=1" must be changed to "BootGui=0".
  *Step 4: Please install CDROM drivers for MSDOS and "MSCDEX.EXE", so that you have access to the CDROM drive at "DOS prompt" of COMMAND.COM.
    *4 - Boot MSDOS from harddisk and run the setup tool of the SUSE CD #1, e.g. "Z:\SETUP.EXE", if "Z" is your CDROM drive. Select Loadlin as booting method and set up the correct amount of memory for Linux, e.g. enter 240 ( 248 ) MByte for a system with 256 MByte main memory and 16 ( 8 ) MByte video memory.
    *5 - Select the textmode installation tool "Yast1" and not the graphical installation tool "Yast2.0" in the menu. This is a must, as the graphics card of the notebook is not VGA hardware compatible !
    *6 - Create a Linux native partition and a Linux swap partition with the Linux tool Fdisk. A good choice for the size of the swap partition is the either single or double size of the main memory ( e.g. I entered "+512M" for my notebook with 256 MByte main memory ). Here is the Fdisk partition table for my 15 GB harddisk:

^ Device name ^ From ^ To ^ Blocks ^ Partition ^ type ^
^ /dev/hda1 | 562 | 689 | 1028160 | 5 | Extended |
^ /dev/hda2 | 690 | 755 | 530145 | 82 | Linux swap |
^ /dev/hda3 | 756 | 1836 | 8683132 | 83 | Linux native |
^ /dev/hda4 | 1 | 561 | 4506201 | b | Win95 FAT32 |
^ /dev/hda5 | 562 | 689 | 1028128 | b | Win95 FAT32 |

=====  Installation of a new Linux Kernel for Computers with SIS630 / SIS630S / SIS630ST Chipset =====
  *Install the Linux kernel 2.4.18 sources or newer. Follow the instructions in the SUSE 7.1 manual, chapter 13 "The Kernel", to install the kernel sources, to compile and install a new Linux kernel:
    *Option 1, for owners of SUSE 7.3 or newer : Let "Yast1" install the packages d/linux and d/lininclude
    *Option 2, if you downloaded the kernel separately: Execute the commands:<code>
cd /usr/src
tar xvfz /path_of_the_downloaded_kernel_archive/linux-2.4.18.tar.gz</code>
    *To let the symblic link "/usr/src/linux" point to this installation directory, e.g. "/usr/src/linux-2.4.18" or "/usr/src/linux-2.4.18.SuSE", please execute the commands:<code>
cd /usr/src
ls
rm linux
ln -s linux-2.4.18 linux</code>
  *Go to the Linux installation directory and call the menu configuration:<code>
cd /usr/src/linux

  *Now compile and install a new Linux kernel and its modules. Follow the instructions in the SUSE 7.1 manual, chapter 13 "The Kernel". Especially you must copy the new kernel to the "C:\LOADLIN" directory of your MSDOS partition. In this example I assume that the MSDOS partition "C:" is mounted in "/dos_c". Execute the commands:<code>
make dep clean bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /dos_c/loadlin/zImage</code>
  *Finally, you must set the environment variable "PCMCIA" to "yenta_socket", manually, by "Yast1" ( "System Administration / Change configuration file / PCMCIA" ). Do not set the value to "tcic" or "i82365", as advised by SUSE.

  *[[https://www.csc.kth.se/~gkreitz/sis630/|Gunnar Kreitz "FreeBSD 4.4 on a BEST Apache C"]].
===== Installation of X-Window and the Framebuffer Device, for Computers with SIS630 / SIS630S / SIS630ST Chipset =====
==== Basics =====
  *In the past, computers with SIS630 / SIS630S / SIS630ST chipset must setup the framebuffer device to make X-Window run ! Read the SUSE 7.1 manual, chapter 8, "The X Window System", subchapter 8.3.3, "Troubleshooting - The graphics card is not supported" and check the "SUSE Support knowledgebase" for the keyword FRAMEBUFFER, but follow the instructions provided here.
  *[[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://sdb.suse.de/en/sdb/html/keylist.FRAMEBUFFER.html|Archive.org "SUSE Keywords.FRAMEBUFFER|FRAME BUFFER"]] ( - 2003-10-04 ).
  *Now, compile and install a new Linux kernel with activated framebuffer support ( see above ).
  *Modify the Loadlin configuration file "C:\LOADLIN\LINUX.PAR" and the LILO configuration file "/etc/lilo.conf": Include the line "vga=791" to use the framebuffer with 1024x768 resolution, 16-bit color depth. 8-, 15-, and 16-bit color depths work, the 24-bit color depth is not available.
  *Use Loadlin or LILO for rebooting Linux, which now makes use of the framebuffer. You see the Linux penguin during the boot process at the left upper corner of your screen.
  *If you want to use a bootdisk for rebooting Linux, you must modify the bootdisk before, so that the proper VESA video mode "791" is activated at boottime, automatically:<code>
make bzdisk
mount /floppy
vidmode /dev/fd0 791</code>
==== X-Windows Installation =====
You may either run XFree86 4.x ( best choice ) or XFree 3.3.x as X-Window server !
=== XFree86 4.x ====
    *To configure XFree86 4.x, don't follow the SUSE instruction ! Especially don't run the command "sax2" ! Instead, execute the command "xf86cfg -textmode" for a comfortable menu based configuration ( best choice ) or the command "xf86config" for the classical console configuration! The name of the framebuffer device is "fbdev". The modified configuration file is written to "/etc/X11/XF86Config". To setup Linux for use with XFree86 4.x, finally, please execute the commands, if necessary:<code>
cd /var/X11R6/bin
dir
rm X
ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/XFree86 X</code>
    *Start X-Window by the command "startx"
=== XFree86 3.3.x ====
  *I failed to configure XFree86 3.3.x of SUSE 7.1. 
    *If you want to try so anyhow, please execute the command xf86config3x". This command is the one named "xf86config" in the SUSE 7.1 manual, by mistake. Don't try to run the commands "sax" and "XF86Setup", as advised by SUSE ! The modified configuration file is written to "/etc/XF86Config". To setup Linux for use with XFree86 3.3.x, finally, please execute the commands, if necessary:<code>
cd /var/X11R6/bin
dir
rm X
ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_FBDev X</code>
    *Start X-Window by the command "startx -- -bpp 16"
    *If you succeed to configure XFree86 3.3.x properly, then please tell me !
    *Note: The XFree86 3.0 server "XFCom_SiS" of 17. March 1999, as supplied with SUSE 7.1, is not suitable for graphics cards with SIS630 / SIS630S / SIS630ST chipset. Especially, the configuration command "xf86config3x" just mentions the predecessor chipset SIS620.
==== LCD + CRT Output Device =====
  *The Clevo 2700c BIOS offers the menu option "Startup / Display" to activate display devices:
    *[ ] CRT
    *[ ] LCD
    *[*] LCD+CRT
  *In fact, with either setting, both LCD and CRT display devices are activated: If you connect a VGA monitor to the notebook and if the VESA BIOS is active, there is always a display on the VGA monitor. Both devices are always addressed in 1024x768 resolution, so that the display quality of the display resolutions 640x480 and 800x600 is reduced the same for LCD and CRT.

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 
^ Graphics screen resolution ^ VESA video mode ^ Effective monitor screen width ^ Horizontal sync frequency ^ Vertical sync frequency ^
^ textmode | - | 1024x768 | 49 KHz | 60 Hz, non-interlaced |
^ 648x480 | vga=785 | 1024x768 | 49 KHz | 60 Hz, non-interlaced |
^ 800x600 | vga=788 | 1024x768 | 49 KHz | 60.5 Hz, non-interlaced |
^ 1024x768 | vga=791 | 1024x768 | 49 KHz | 60 Hz, non-interlaced |
^ | | | | |

  *So while a Linux text console is displayed, or if X-Window uses the VESA framebuffer driver, the VESA BIOS is active and controls the horizontal and vertical sync frequencies. Just if a X-Window server is running, using a special SIS 630S driver and while the X-Window console is displayed, the horizontal and vertical sync frequencies are taken from the file "/etc/X11/XF86Config" !
  *So be aware, VGA monitors with a maximum horizontal frequency of less than 49 KHz, as usual in the early 1990th, don't work with this notebook !
  *In opposite to MSDOS and Linux, Win98SE and W2K always override the VESA BIOS by its special graphics drivers.
===== Linux Network Installation Tips =====
  *In addition to the built-in network adapter, my notebook is equipped with an NE2000 compatible "10M Ethernet COMBO FL-4680" PC Card of Fiberline Technology Corp., once sold by [[http://www.atelco.de/|Atelco]] and [[http://www.pearl.de/|PEARL Agency]]. I found a confirmation of inofficial Linux support for this PC Card.
    *[[http://tuxmobil.org/pcmcia_linux_status.html|TuxMobil "Linux PCMCIA/CF/CardBus Card Survey (sorted by Linux Support Status)"]].
      *[[http://tuxmobil.org/pcmcia_ci10109.html|TuxMobil "PCMCIA/CardBus/CF-Card Linux Survey: Fiberline 10M Ethernet COMBO FL-4680"]].
  *After each run of the script SuSEconfig, you must modify the file "/etc/hosts" if you like to assign the host name to several IPs, or to assign a different host name for each IP. Note that "Yast1" runs this script mostly, automatically.
  *Please use "Yast1" ( "System Administration / Network configuration / Network base configuration" ) to mark all network devices as "Active". Especially, network devices of PC Cards must be marked to be of "PCMCIA" type.
  *Currently, I may not use both the SIS 900/7016 network adapter and the PC Card network adapter with Linux, concurrently, if both network adapters are configured to be in the same subnet ( e.g. 192.168.1.* ). You may list all active network adapters by the command ifconfig.
    *If the PC Card is not activated ( i.e. the PC Card with the media coupler is not plugged into the PC Card slot ), I may access the local network connected to the SIS 900/7016 network adapter.
    *If the PC Card is activated ( i.e. the PC Card with the media coupler is plugged into the PC card slot ), access to the local network connected to the SIS 900/7016 network adapter is disabled: A ping to an IP of that local network "hangs". Access to the local network connected to the PC Card is granted.
     *In opposite, I may use both network adapters with Windows, concurrently.
