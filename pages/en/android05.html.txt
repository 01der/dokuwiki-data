  *Emulation of Android smartphones is ok, emulation of Android tablets is slow ( due to the higher performance level of these devices ).
  *Graphics Configuration:
    *If your Win8 or Linux computer really provides OpenGL2 graphics, you may operate the simulator with default setting "Emulated Performance - [x] Use Host GPU".
    *But if your Win8 or Linux computer just provides OpenGL1 graphics, as my Win8 PCs "ASUS Eee PC T101MT" and "Dell Vostro 1000" notebooks with standard Windows drivers by Microsoft, you are lost:
      *If you try to operate the simulator with default setting "Emulated Performance - [x] Use Host GPU", the Android Simulator crashes by the error message "APPCRASH", "Fault Module name: libOpenglRender.dll".
      *If you operate the Android simulator just with the setting "Emulated Performance - [ ] Use Host GPU", you may just run Android applications on "API 1" level.
        *If you try Android applications with a higher API level, e.g. "API 15",
          *The Android desktop screen is not displayed but just black screen with "android" in white letters.
          *When executing "Run / Device Chooser / Choose a running device / Compatible" again, there is the error message "No, minSDK(API 15) > deviceSDK(API 1)”, if "minSDKVersion 15" is set in the project configuration file "app".

  *For Win8-32-bit PCs with 2GB of physical RAM and another 2GB virtual memory, 
    *With the default settings of "Nexus 5 API 23", the emulator stops by the error message "emulator: WARNING: Requested RAM size of 1536MB is too large for your environment, and is reduced to 1152MB. Cannot set up guest memory 'android_arm': Invalid argument".
    *You may operate Android simulation with 343MB, 512MB or even 768MB simulated RAM.
    *I still don´t know if is advisable to decrease the default simulated RAM of simulated devices with "big" RAM ( e.g. 1024MB, 1536MB RAM ), or instead to prefer a simlated image with "low" RAM ( e.g. 343MB RAM ).
    *Error message:<code>
Your emulator is out of date, please update by launching Android Studio:
 - Start Android Studio
 - Select menu "Tools > Android > SDK Manager"
 - Click "SDK Tools" tab
 - Check "Android SDK Tools" checkbox

    *It doesn´t help to increase the virtual memory of the Windows host computer...
  *The simulator' camera doesn't work on Win8.1. Calling the camera is aborted by the error message "Unfortunately, camera has stopped".
  *The user may check manually for Notifications ( as the simulator provides an unmodified desktop application as known from hardware smartphones, in opposite to some other Android simulators ).
==== Andy Android Emulator -> Android 4.2.2 ====
  *The free Android emulator [[http://www.andyroid.net/|Andy Android Emulator]] for Win-32bit, Win64-bit and MacOSX.
    *If you load the website with a Win-32bit, you get a download offer of the Win-32bit edition of the software.
      *On my notebook "Dell Vostro 1000" with AMD XP3600 CPU and standard Windows graphics drivers shipped with Win8.1, "Andy_v45.5_63" installs, but doesn´t start properly: The application never appears on the screen :-(.
    *If you load the website with a Win-64bit, you get a download offer of the Win-32bit edition of the software.

Intel offers just an Android operating system for some special x86 hardware boards.

  *Special characters like "@".
    *With Android simulators on Windows, with German keyboard at the physical host, you can´t enter some characters which require special keypresses, e.g. "@" requires ALT-GR and "Q" to be pressed simulatiously. 
    *But usually you may copy it on the Windows host from an editor by CTRL-C and paste it at the simulator in the Android application by CTRL-V.
  *Smartphone apps which require multi-touch are hard to use with smartphone simulators operated by keyboard & mouse, as mouse input is just single-touch input. So how about keyboard shortcuts just for smartphone simulators :-)?
    *Remember a car simulator with offers "gas" and "break" - if the screen distance is too big, you you can´t switch from "gas" to "break" by mouse operation immediately, as required.
    *Remember a military flight simulator, with "target cross" and "fire button" as interactive screen inputs. With multi-touch, you may move the "target cross" with one finger, while you press the "fire button" on the screen with another finger. With single-input by mouse, you are lost. Really.
