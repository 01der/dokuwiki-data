===== IO-Link & Industry 4.0 =====
  *Vision of Peter K Wienzek, [[http://www.xing.com/profile/Peter_Wienzek|XING "Peter Wienzek"]], [[http://www.linkedin.com/in/peterwienzek|LinkedIn "Peter K Wienzek"]] in 2016:
==== Concept for Low Data Throughput: PLC as IO-Master  ====
  *If there is just little IOT data throughput, a PLC may process it and **push** the data to the cloud.
  *[[http://www.festo-didactic.com/de-de/lernsysteme/trainingspakete/automatisierungstechnik-sps/festo-cecc-codesys-v3-kompaktsteuerung.htm|Festo Didactic SE "Festo CECC CODESYS® V3 Kompaktsteuerung"]] - An enty-level PLC with "4x IO Link Master, 1x IO Link Device".
==== Concept for High Data Throughput: IO-Master as Gateway to the Cloud ====
  *There is no need that PLCs process all the "IOT / Industry 4.0" data.  This is CPU power consuming ( makes the devices hot,..) and especially increases the PLC cycle time.
  *Instead, an IOT Gateway ( e.g. a IO-Link Master ) should be used as data separator and as component of a Historian or even a simple MES system. A software agent on the IO gateway **pushes** data to the cloud.
    *Sensor data needed by the PLC is sent to the PLC.
    *While data just needed to be collected ( e.g. for energy management ) should be sent to the IT infrastructure ( local database, datacenter, cloud ).
    *The Cloud services may get additional data by **pulling** data from the PLC, by the help of an agent installed on the PLC.
===== Resources =====
  *No bus, but a P2P network. You can change an IO-Link sensor device easily, as the configuration parameters are not stored on the device, but on the IO-Link controller.
  *Experts told me:
    *Cycle time calculation example: 
      *COM2 ( 38.4 kBaud ), 1 Byte process data -> cycle time 2.3 ms, i.e. the data is updated all 2.3 ms.
    *Unique selling proposition: 3 unshielded wires, 20 meters cable length.
    *Sensors of IO-Link devices may generate events ( e.g. the sensor needs to be cleaned ), which are sent to the IO-Link master. The IO-Link master may sent to the master display in the control room.
    *Developer's advices to avoid severe timing problems:
      *16/32-bit microcontrollers provide enough computing power, while 8-bit microcontrollers might not be sufficient to follow the timing requirements of the IO-Link protocol when serving the IO-Link device functionality.
      *The clock on IO-Link sensor boards must be generated by an external on-board quartz crystal, but you may not use the on-chip clock generated by microcontrollers. On-chip clocks don´t provide temperature stability!
      *The Flash ROM of IO-Link boards must be implemented as "fully functional EPROM". Be warned that some micocontrollers have on-chip Flash ROM, which doesn´t satisfy this requirements.
