===== My Clevo 2700c Notebook =====
  *I bought my "Clevo 2700c" notebook, branded as "[[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.baycom-notebooks.de/|Baycom]] Worldbook" notebook, at [[http://www.atelco.de/|ATELCO Computer]]. Later, [[http://www.tronic5.de/|tronic'5]] was using the trademark "Baycom", in Germany.
  *It was a premature budget decision to buy this notebook. With a little more money, I might have bought a notebook of DELL - with a longer guarantee / warrenty period, better support, a bigger display, better technical data and better performance when running LINUX. How about you ?
===== The Clevo 2700c Notebook Family =====
  *A note about Clevo. I was told, that there was a sort of discontinuity in 1999 or so. The old company Clevo was closed down, but the name was assigned to a new company which continued business. Must be very easy in Taiwan...
  *The Clevo 2700c / 2200c, 2700s / 2200s and Clevo 2700t / 2200t notebooks are sister models. The single differences:
    *The 2700c / 2200c models have a non-mobile CPU, SIS630S chipset, S-Video ("TV") output, a standard parallel printer port and a standard PCI 1394 firewire interface. They haven't any serial RS-232 interface ( "COM1" ).
    *The 2700s / 2200s models have a mobile CPU, SIS630S chipset, a standard parallel printer port and a serial RS-232 interface ( "COM1" ). They have no S-Video ("TV") output and are not equipped with a standard PCI 1394 firewire interface.
    *The 2700t / 2200t models are like the 2700c / 2200c models, but are equipped with a SIS630ST chipset.
    *2700 models differ from 2200 modells by the case color ! [[imprint.html|Tell me]] if you know about other differences!
  *Clevo once offered drivers and both user manuals and technical for free download, by FTP ( [[ftp://ftp.clevo.com.tw/|FTP "ftp.clevo.com.tw"]] ).

==== TV Output & Audio Output ====
  *SIS integrated a [[http://www.chrontel.com/|Chrontel]] CH7005 compatible hardware into the SIS630 chipset ( see "Display / Configuration" of Win98SE, if the S-Video output is activated by attaching a TV set to the notebook ).
    *[[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.chrontel.com/products/7005.htm|Archive.org "CH7005 Digital PC to TV Encoder - Chrontel - The world's leading supplier of PC-TV encoders"]].
  *The [[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.ab.ru/~lookin/|Video Live]] tools ( - 2007-12-16 ) support the Chrontel 7005 chipset !
  *With "S-Video > FBAS" converters, my notebook may be connected to RGB monitors, TV sets and video recorders without S-Video input.
    *[[http://www.wilhelmy-it.de/|SVID]], a S-Video > FBAS converter.
    *[[http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/bastelecke/Rund%20um%20den%20PC/SVHS-FBAS-Konverter/|Henrik Haftmann]] - "S-VHS-zu-FBAS-Konverter (ganz einfach!?)".
  *A "line to microphone" ( [[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/line_to_mic.html|"Line level signal to microphone input adapter"]] ( - 2007-01-27 ), [[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.edcorusa.com/gadgeteer/tech_notes/tn06.htm|Archive.org "EDCOR Electronics - Line to Microphone Output"]] ( - 2004-03-10 ) ) converter may adapt an audio signal with line-in level, like that of TV adapters with USB interface, to microphone input level. Note that many notebooks don't have a line-in input, but just a microphone input !
==== Remote Control ====
    *With [[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.irassistant.com/dotcom/v_current/|Archive.org "IRAssistant"]] ( - 2008-09-11 ), you may control your notebook by an infrared remote control.
===== Windows on Notebooks with SIS630 / SIS630S / SIS630ST Chipset =====
  *Win98SE works fine and stable on my notebook. The driver CD claims complete to provide W2K support, too ( untested ).
  *Installation note: The file "sis630.cat" is located on the driver CD at "Z:\video\win2000\win2000\sis630.cat" but not at "Z:\video\win9x\" nore at "Z:\video\win9x\german\".
  *Installation advice: Please copy the LAN and AUDIO driver directory from the driver CD onto the harddisk, so that concurrent access both to the driver files and the original WIN98 CD is possible - else you risk a failure of the installation process.
  *Installation advice by AndrÃ© Ballentin: Please install the sound card prior to the modem !
  *For my notebook with SiS630S chipset, the utility SISIDE.EXE of the archive "W2kdma.exe", which was once available at SiS, helps changing the SiS IDE controller running in PIO mode to run in DMA mode under Win95/98 and W2K.
