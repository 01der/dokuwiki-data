=== TinyDB & The App Inventor Online Demo Service ( based on TinyDB ) ====
  *[[http://appinvtinywebdb.appspot.com/|App Inventor for Android: Tiny WebDB Service]] - "This service is only a demo. The database will store at most 250 entries; adding entries beyond that will cause the oldest entries to be deleted. Also, individual data values are limited to at most 500 characters".
  *[[http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/custom-tinywebdb-service.html|MIT App Inventor "Custom TinyWebDB Service"]].
  *Your tags are visible to all other global users, so you have to define tags with unique application-specific name for your own application. I.e. don´t use "demo", "test",.. :-).
  *Derek Walter, Mark Sherman: "Any  data tha you put in a TinyWebDB - even if you create your own service -  can possibly be read by anyone... Additionally anyone can cal the erase command in TinyWebDB  bcause that comamnd doues not require a passwod, either".

  *There is a free client on the client computer, "aiStarter", which enables the online service to upload applications to your local Android device or local Android simulator :-).
    *"The local client server "aiStarter" which communicates with the Online Service & with the Android Simulator.
    *The "ai2starter" webserver is running at [[http://127.0.0.1:8004/|127.0.0.1:8004]].
    *The "App Inventor 2 Setup" is shipped with a complete ( slow ) Android device simulator.
      *The Windows edition of Android device simulator is for Win32-bit and Win64-bit. 
      *If you got some other ( faster ) Android device simulator installed, and if such is running, e.g. permanently as background task like BlueStacks on Windows, or in the foreground as standard Windows application, it is used automatically instead of the shipped Android device simulator.
  *Utilities and components of AI2 ( to be started separately, e.g. by supplied batch files ) are at "C:\Program Files (x86)\AppInventor\commands-for-appinventor".
  *[[http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/windows-drivers.html|MIT "Windows Drivers for Android Phones"]].
    *The "App Inventor Extras" were a former name for  bundle of necessary USB drivers and software to make your computer aware of and connect to the smartphone. Don´t look for it, it's outdated and legacy.

=== The App Inventor 2 Runtime ===
  *Typechecking is performed at runtime. If you try to do the arithmetic "+" operation with a list and a numeric operator, you get the runtime error<code>
Runtime Error. The operation + cannot accept the arguments: [()][1]
</code>
=== My personal Experience with the App Inventor 2 Platform - Limits and Specials ====
  *The project name can´t contain spaces, but just underscores. However, the name of the app, as visible in the appstore, is defined in the settings of "Screen 1" at "AppName". This app name may contain spaces.
  *According to my personal experience, what's missing with "App Inventor 2" or what can't be implemented?
    *"ActionBar" :-(.
    *Dynamic loading of images in a GUI List component.
    *Creating of Notifications which can be viewed by the status bar :-(.
      *With the discontinued "MIT Inventor 1", it was possible to create Notifications, which can be viewed by pulling down the status bar. See [[http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/alertme.html|MIT "AlertMe: Texting in the background, when app is not running"]].
      *With "MIT Inventor 2", you may just create Notifications, which are displayed immediately by modale windows :-(. The alarm notification even only works on the screen where the notification is implemented. Exiting the app cancels the alarms :-(. 
  *The "MIT Inventor 2" offers to build apps with "List View" only. 
    *Mostly there is some space put automatically between GUI components, both in the IDE and later at runtime.
    *In opposite, with most GUI builders ( i.e. Visual Studio, QT Designer / QT Creator, Borland JBuilder, GUI builders for Python with Tkinter,.. ), you may create space-free GUI design. I.e. you must put a GUI label between 2 GUI components if you want to separate them by space.
  *By the "Build" option, you may create executable Apps. 
    *The name of the App later in the App launcher & desktop is defined by the project name of "Android Inventor 2", which can´t contain spaces. You need to apply the "AppToMarket" desktop application to transform the project name into a wanted name ( e.g. with campitalized letters and/or space (" ") between parts of the name.
    *However, the Android emulator is shipped with the "MIT Android Inventor 2" is running "Android 2.2" ( API Level: 8 ). 
    *I was told by experts, that for Google Play submission the "Version" must be a number higher than the previous APK.
    *For preparing the publication of such generated Apps by [[http://play.google.com/apps/publish|Google Play Developer Console]]. 
      *There is the optimisation tip, marked red-crossed "Your Production APK needs to meet the following criteria "The minimum Android version and target Android version need to support tablets (check targetSdkVersion and minSdkVersion)"
        *[[http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2.html|Android Developers "Android 2.2 APIs"]] - "API Level: 8".
        *[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history|EN.Wikipedia "Android version history"]].

          *"8. Target Android Versions Properly. To ensure the broadest possible distribution to tablets, make sure that your app properly targets the Android versions that support tablets. Initial support for tablets was added in Android 3.0 (API level 11). Unified UI framework support for tablets, phones, and other devices was introduced in Android 4.0".
          *"At a minimum, check the <uses-sdk> element to make sure that:
            *"targetSdkVersion is declared with value 11 or higher (14 or higher is recommended), OR".
            *"minSdkVersion is declared with value 11 or higher".

          *"I've had a user complain that privacy settings are an issue in my app, and it generally is a result of default settings on android:minSdkVersion = 1.0 if not specified by the .apk file. I need to set minSdkVersion to 4 in order to avoid the privacy issue I am seeing".
        *Suggestions #1 to get listet as tablet-ready app at "Google Play" and to be compatible with [[http://www.google.com/admob/|Google AdMob]]:
          *minSDK = 9 ( AdMob ).
          *targetSDK = 11 ( tablet ).
        *Suggestions #1 to get listet as tablet-ready app at "Google Play":
          *minSDK = 11 ( tablet & AdMob).
          *targetSDK = 0 ( legacy setting for compatibility, according to "AppToMarket" ).

         *"I did make some headway on this.  I was able to publish my app yesterday to both Google Play and to Amazon and SUPPORT tablets. I have included a copy of the manifest to show how I did it". "After adding the xLargeScreens, bumping the minSdkVersion to 9,  I also needed to add the android uses-feature to enable tablets" -> So it is important to disable non-existing features on tablets by "<use-feature>" to convince Google Play that an app is tablet-ready :-)<code>

  *Where to store developer keys ( e.g. Twitter developer key and password "Consumer Key", "Consumer Secret" )?
    *You shouldn´t store it in the "Android Inventor 2" project as visible data :-(, when you update the project by the "Gallery Update" function.
      *You might have work during development with 2 copies of the software, one with development key and one without?
    *You might offer an app compiled of a "Android Inventor 2" project, with or without encryption :-(.
      *You might store the developer key in a file of the file system :-(.
      *You might store the developer key in a TinyDB database :-(.
      *You might get the key from your own remote server, like toe communications service [[http://www.twilio.com/|Twillo]]. 
        *But of course you must identify yourself at the server... e.g. by your phone number, or the user must register at the website so that this username & password is stored at runtime on your smartphone ( in the TInyDB database, in a file, or temporary in a global list / global variable ).
        *And the developer key communication than runs by the server, not by the smartphone app...

Clicking "Watch" opens a baloon whose result constantly monitors the value of the variable, so you can see if your program is changing it as anticipated".

==== Tips & Tricks ====
  *Sometimes during editing with MIT Inventor e.g. at the block "When <Screen1> .initialize", there is an error message. Solution: Reload the HTML page of the MIT Android Inventor IDE ( by pressing the browser's reload button) :-):<code>
Error from Companion: java.lang.RuntimeException: invalid syntax in eval form:<string>:1:142: call to 'set-and-coerce-property!' has too few arguments (3; must be 4)
</code>
  *Though the "MIT Inventor 2" is a simple web page to be loaded by an Internet browser, and though the "MIT AI2 Companion" properly installs and runs on Win-32bit systems, the whole system just works properly on Win64-bit :-(. 
    *On Win-32bit with 2GB RAM, there is no display of the visualisation of the app prototype. On Win-32bit with 3GB RAM, the visualisation of the app prototype is displayed properly.
    *On Win-32bit with 2GB RAM, there are often error messages by the browser about time delays. On Win-32bit with 3GB RAM this doesn´t happen.
    *With "App Inventor 2 Ultimate" on Win-32bit with 2GB RAM, there is even the Windows error message<code>
Error message:
Close programs to prevent information loss.
Your computer is low on memory. Save your files and close these programs:
Java(TM) Platform SE binary
</code>
    *But even on On Win-32bit with 3GB RAM, where the Android device simulator properly loads, the Android device simulator and especially the transfer process of the created app, is too slow for practical work :-(. I even didn´t manage to transfer and start a simple Android app :-(, even after accepting many time delays.
