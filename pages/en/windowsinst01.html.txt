====== [hemmerling] The Sequence of Steps of a Windows 2000 ( W2k ) Installation  ======
===== Prerequisites ======
  *Save the mail filter of Thunderbird E-mail client, especially if you move to a new location with a new E-Mail database ( it is stored in the mail folder, and is still available if you deinstall and reinstall Thunderbird on the same computer and same operating system ).
===== The Process ======
The Sequence of Steps of a typical Windows Installation, with Installation of Application Software, taking W2k-Pro / W2k-Server as example:
  -Hardware Rules.
    -Suggetion: Installation of an operating system ( here: Windows ) *just* with 1 physical drive. 
      *Its ok to disconnect the power supply of the secondary controller. 
      *But for the primary controller, Windows (!) does not like to have a second powerless drive connected to the ATAPI cable. So for the primary controller, please disconnect the ATAPI cable. With connected ATAPI cable, the Windows NTLDR might fail before the NT boot menu is displayed. There is an explicite error message of the NTLDR.
    -Must for motherboards with RAID controllers: Please disconnect the power of RAID drives, until you installed the RAID controller drivers unter Windows. Else the Windows might "hang" before the NTLDR runs and the NT boot menus is displayed :-(.
  -The Basics.
    -Be shure that there is no C:\WINNT" on the file system of the boot partition 
      *Either let Windows format the boot partition during installation.
      *Or boot by another operating system with NTFS access and delete the directory "C:\WINNT" on the NTFS boot partition ( or rename it ), before a new Windows installation.
    -Installation of Windows, with "Windows W2kServer CD".
      *//Change the drives of DVD/CD drives to high drive letters starting with "Z" ( "Settings / ControlPanel / Administrative Tools / Computer Management" ).//
      *//Install the "Recovery Console" from CD, e.g. run "Z:\i386\winnt32.exe /cmdcons"//. Be shure to install the "Recovery Console" before you install updates, especially before you install Windows service packs ( SP ). Windows refuses to install the "Recovery Console" from the original Windows installation CD, if it detects that the Windows on the installation CD has a different version than the running Windows.
      *//Windows "Settings / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Local Security Policy / Security Settings / Local Policies / Security Options"//.
        *//"Recovery Console: Allow floppy copy and access to all drives and folders" -> "Enabled" ( Default is "Disabled" )//.
        *//"Recovery Console: Allow automatic administrative login"-> "Disabled" ( Default is "Disabled" )//.
      *//Windows "Settings / Control Panel / Users and Passwords"//.
        *//"Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer" -> "[x]" ( Default is "[ ]" )//.
    -Change of CD/DVD drives to X:, Y:, Z: ( "Start / Settings - Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Computer Management / Disk Management" ).
    -Set the name of the computer. Set the Windows workgroup name to "WORKGROUP", as the [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRITZ!Box|Fritz!Box]] 7270 router is limited just to be member of this Windows workgroup.
    -Enable network sharing of all drivers -> "My Computer".
      *Taking "Drive C:" as example -> "Properties / Sharing / [x] Share this folder", "Share name = NODE3_C", "Comment = NODE3_C".
    -Change of the directory / path for temporary files ( "Start / Settings - Control Panel / System / Advanced / Environment Variables" )..
      *User variables for Administrator.
        -"TEMP = C:\tmp;".
        -"TMP = C:\tmp;".
      *System variables.
        -"TEMP = C:\tmp;".
        -"TMP = C:\tmp;".
      -Change the settings for virtual memory from a temporary file to a permanent file. Put the virtual memory file to an extra partition, if you can ( "Start / Settings - Control Panel / System / Advanced / Performance Options / Virtual Memory - Change /" ) 
        *Initial size = 3072.
        *Maximum size = 3072.
