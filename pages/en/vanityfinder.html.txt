====== [hemmerling] VanityFinder ======
  *VanityFinder helps you to convert classical numeric telephone numbers to vanity telephone numbers, and vice versa ! A great help if you deal with vanity phone numbers or if you think about ordering a vanity telephone number.
  *On this WEB site and especially in context with the program "VanityFinder", I am using the term "vanity" in a descriptive manner and not in the meaning of a trademark: "Vanity" telephone numbers are telephone numbers, where the single numbers are associated with one or more characters, by instructions on the telephone set.
