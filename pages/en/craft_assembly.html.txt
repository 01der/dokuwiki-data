====== [hemmerling] Assembly by Rolf Hemmerling ======
  *Here are samples of my skills as assembler and reassembler of ready made pieces made by industry to unique objects of art ( bicycles ):
    *During my compulsory military service 1981-07 - 1982-09 at the german army [[http://www.bundeswehr.de/|Deutsche Bundeswehr]], I passed a basic training with concentration on vehicle repair. Additionally I took an introductory course for gas welding at the [[http://www.hwk-flensburg.de/|Chamber of Crafts and Trades Flensburg]], Germany, in 1982-01. 1982-08 - 1982-10, I joined a basic practical training "Metall" ( "Metal" ) at [[http://www.stadtwerke-bielefeld.de/|Stadtwerke Bielefeld GmbH]], Germany. In the late 1980th, I improved my skills at the bicycle repair workshop [[http://www.fahrradwerkstatt-hannover.de/|Fahrradwerkstatt Glocksee]] Hannover.
