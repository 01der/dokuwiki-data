===== Inside the Canadian Pavillion at the EXPO2000 in Hannover - Main show: Multimedia show with water and light effects =====
<WRAP column 70%>
The main show uses videos, supported by impressive water and light effect, to explain the different facilities of living and working in Canada. The show room is a circlular. In the mid at the top of the room, there is a big circular video screen, surrounded by some similar, but smaller circular video screens. At the ground, there is a water basin with a fountain installation. This photo is not of perfect quality. How about visiting the show by yourself, to get a perfect impression ?

===== Inside the Canadian Pavillion at the EXPO2000 in Hannover - The fair stall of The Digital Group of Telehealth Companies =====
<WRAP column 70%>
This is the fair stall of [[http://www.telehealth.ca/|The Digital Group of Telehealth Companies]], which sponsored my full-day trip to the EXPO2000 in Hannover, Germany. It presents a remote communication system between a medical center and a remote patient: Visual and audio contact can be established, medical data of the patient may be recorded and transfered to the medical center. A good starting point for a discussion, with focus on the motto of the EXPO2000 "Humankind - Nature - Technology": Will this be the future, for all the people of the world ? And would this be useful and good ? Think about it and make up your mind by yourselfes, Dear visitors !
