== History ==
  *The free "HPQC Community Edition 12.20", released 2015-01-15 is for 64-bit Windows and 64-bit Linux only. For Windows, there is just a directory "Z:\ALM_Win64".
  *The just-commercial "HPQC 12" for 64-bit Windows and 64-bit Linux only, released 2014-02-10, doesn´t offer a community edition license. For Windows, there is just a directory "Z:\ALM_Win64".
  *The just-commercial "HPQC 11.52" is the latest edition with 32-bit support for Windows and Linux. It doesn`t offer a community edition license. For Windows, there are 2 directories "Z:\ALM_Win64" and "Z:\ALM_Win32". 
    *As shipped it installs properly on Win7Pro. 
    *Installation message: "Database Server: MS-SQL server must be installed in the same server machine as ALM server. If it is not installed on the machine, download MS-SQL Express 2008... Important Note. While installing MS-SQL Express, set 'SQL Instance' to 'Default' and 'Authentification mode' to 'Mixed'. After the installation has completed, run the SQL Server Configuration Manager from start menu and set TCP/IP to 'Enabled'. Make shure that MS-SQL server is running, then click 'Configure Database'".
    *Error Message "The wizard could not determine if MS-SQL Express is installed on this machine. If MS-SQL Express is installed on the machine, make shure that it is configured using the 'Default', and not the 'Named' instance".

=== Installation ===
== System requirements ==
  *Host operating system: 64-bit Windows Server 2008 / 2012 or 64-bit Red Hat / Oracle / SUSE Linux.
  *Host database: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 / 2012  or Oracle 11.2.0.3 / 11.2.0.4 / 12.1.0.1. The application is not shipped with a free edition of any of the SQL servers, so you have to setup a suitable database server by your own, before, properly.
  *CLient browsers: Microsoft Explorer, Firefox ( Win, Linux ), Chrome ( Win, MacOSX ), Safari ( MacOSX ).
== Possible Installation Failures ==
  *On 32-bit computers, running Win7/Win8 and Java8, the installation aborts with the error message<code>
LaunchAnywhere Error. Windows error 216 occured while loading the Java VM</code>
  *On 64-bit computers running Win8Pro and Java8, the installation aborts with the error message<code>
Installation Error. ERROR: This machine's operating system is not supported and recommended ALM (2.20) server. The installation cannot continue.</code>
  *You may not install 2 different versions of HPQC on the same computer. If you try, the installer aborts with the error message<code>
Installation Error. THe installation cannot continue. A newer ALM version is already installed on this machine</code>
== Installation Process, Part 1 ==
  *Install "Microsoft SQL Server Express 2014", if not already done. Tips for suitable configuration see infos below about the HPQC installation process.
  *Configure "Microsoft SQL Server Express 2014" properly for use with HPQC, by activation of TCP/IP.
    *Call "Microsoft SQL Server Configuration Manager", connect to the SQL server
      *Set "SQL Server Network Configuration / Protocols for SQLEXPRESS / TCP/IP / Protcocol / General / Enabled= 'Yes' ".
        *Set "SQL Server Network Configuration / Protocols for SQLEXPRESS / TCP/IP / IP Addresses / IPALL".
          *"TCP DynmicPorts = ''".
          *"TCP Port = '1433'".
      *Restart "SQL Services / SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)" by mouse-rightclick "Restart".
    *See [[http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/ab76cc10-5880-46f0-8f47-2e27709230ff/what-is-ms-sql-db-host-name-and-db-port-number-?forum=sqltools|Microsoft SQL Server Forums "What is MS SQL DB host name and DB port number ?"]].
  *Installation on 64-bit computers running Win8Pro and Java8:
    *Mount the ISO image.
    *All files are read-lonly. If you try to unset the "Read-only" attribute, even as Windows systemaccount "Administrator", there is the error message<code>
Access Denied. You will need to provide administrator permission to change these attributes</code>
    *Therefore, please copy the contents of the ISO image to a directory on a local drive. 
    *Modify the file "Z:\ALM_Win64\validation.xml" 
      *From '<os enabled="false"/>' to '<os enabled="false"/>' to run the application on the unsupported operating system "Win8".
      *From '<db-supported="false"/>' to '<db-supported="false"/>' to use the application with an unsupported database, e.g. "Microsoft SQL Server Express 2014".
    *This is the file "validation.xml" with proper modifications<code>
<validations>
	<os enabled="false"/>
	<memory enabled="true" threshold="8"/>
	<installation_disk_space enabled="true" threshold="8"/>
	<db-supported enabled="false"/>
	<license-key enabled="true"/>

  *In opposite, the ISO images of "HPQC 11.52" and "HPQC 12" are shipped with a demo project, at "Z:\ALM Demo_Project". 
  *Is this the HPQC project for the "Mercury Tours" Demo ?
== LAB_PROJECT ==
  *If you install the HPQC trial version, there is an additional project not available with the HPQC Community Edition already mounted in the database: LAB_PROJECT.
== Resources ==
  *Remember, Hewlett-Packard promises in its official documentations: "You cannot import Quality Center project export files (.qcp files) to Quality Center if they were created in an earlier version of Quality Center" :-(.
== HPQC Community Edition ==
  *Unfortunately, with the "HP Quality Center 12.20 Community Edition", the import of project export files ( .qcp ) is disabled :-(.
== HPQC Trial Version ==
  *The database files "demo_demo_db.mdf" and "demo_demo_db_log.ldf" of the project DEMO is at "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA".
  *If necessary to be able move the database files, please shut down the service "SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)".
== Import of the DEMO and LAB_PROJECT Projects into the HPQC Community Edition ==
  *Install HPQC Trial editon.
  *Shut down the HPQC Trial server.
  *Move the files of the directory of SQL Server, e.g. "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA" to a special directory.
    *"demo_demo_db.mdf".
    *"demo_demo_db_log.ldf".
    *"default_lab_project_db.mdf".
    *"default_lab_project_db_log.ldf".
  *At the "Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio", login by Windows Authentication and delete the database "qcsiteadmin_db". This database contains the expireing trial license.
  *Install HPQC Community editon, by "(x) Yes, I want to keep all current settings".
    *Create the domain "DEMO" and the projects "DEMO" and "LAB_PROJECT" within the domain "DEMO".
  *Shut down the HPQC Community Edition server.
  *Renaming. The filenames of the copied files must match the ones created by the software application, sometimes the file name is not "demo_demo_db.mdf", but e.g. "demo_demo_db0.mdf".
    *Rename "default_lab_project_db.mdf" to "demo_lab_project_db.mdf".
    *Rename "default_lab_project_db_log.ldf" to "demo_lab_project_db_log.ldf". 
  *Copy now the files from the spechial directory into the DATA directory of SQL Server, e.g. "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA". Check the filenames. 
  *Activate the HPQC HPQC Community Edition server.

=== First Steps ===
  *Create a new domain.
  *Create a project.
    *With my "HPQC" & "MS SQL Server" installation and configuration, I get the error message<code>
Some of the database servers do not have the text search feature enabled.
After this process completes, you can enable the text search in the DB Servers tab and then click the Enable/Rebuild Text Search button for this project from the Site Projects tab.
</code>
=== Using "HP Screen Recorder" ===
  *Server address: "[[http://localhost:8080/qcbin|http://localhost:8080/qcbin]]".
  *The screen recorder must be connected to an active HPQC project ( mouse-rightclick "Activate Project" ). If there is more an one active project, you may select a certain project ( "Domain", "Project" ), when connecting to the ALM/QC server. The screen recorder may detect if there is not even a single active project. If so, it gives feedback by the error message:<code>
Warning. There are no associated projects. Please contact your project/site administrator.
</code>
  *If you didn´t assign the a "Full License" to the user ( e.g. "sa" ) to , then the use of the screen recording application is refused by the error message<code>
ALM/QC. You don´t have a valid license to connect to ALM/QC. The application will be closed
</code>
  *The video data is stored at "C:\Users\<username>\Documents\HP Screen Recorder Movies".
