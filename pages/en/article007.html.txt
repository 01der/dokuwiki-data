===== ITIL - A FRAMEWORK FOR IT QUALITY MANAGEMENT =====
Written by Rolf Hemmerling

==== About Me ====
My name is Rolf Hemmerling and I am from Hannover, Germany. I am a Consultant, Quality Assurance Representative and Internal Auditor.
I have experience in ISO 9000, ISO 27000, IT software development, engineering, and 25 years practicing the principle of lifelong learning.

==== The learning experience ====
I would like to enroll in an ITIL course as self-study does not always help to focus on the important aspects, neither for passing the certification, nor for the later practical operation. I donÂ´t want to learn "just for a certificate", without further knowledge and work experience.

==== The ITIL Framework ====
I choose to study the ITIL Framework because it provides proven methods. These methods help to implement a "generic" quality system like ISO 9000 in an IT organization. 

I have applied my knowledge of ITIL by creating a reference model of a small datacenter service company, observing that the staff already implemented much of basic ITIL, like helpdesk and ticket system, without knowing explicitly about ITIL. So ITIL must be right!

I look forward to undertaking the ITIL v3 Foundation course and gaining an official qualification.
