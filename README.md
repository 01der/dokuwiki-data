# dokuwiki-data
The contents of my website http://hemmerling.free.fr, a database-alike link collection, administered by the Wiki system "DokuWiki" ( http://www.dokuwiki.org ). This archive contains the actual contents as text files in DokuWiki format, to be placed in DokuWiki within the file system as folder "data".      

Installation: 
  - Install and configure DokuWiki in the file system of your content management system server. DokuWiki is a PHP application, suitable to run on a web server. DokuWiki doesn't require an SQL database.
  - Install and configure a suitable DokuWiki template. I recommend  the DokuWiki template "roundbox" ( http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:roundbox ) for content management systems. My online version is running with the DokuWiki template  ”incognitek” ( http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:incognitek )
  - Download this archive as "dokuwiki-data-master.zip".
  - Dearchiviere it by an Unzip tool.
  - Rename the main folder "dokuwiki-data-master" to "data".
  - Copy the folder "data" to the root folder of your Dokuwiki installation, e.g. by moving with overwriting.
  - Please don´t publish my link collection, or parts of it, online in Internet, without prior modification. So please no 1:1 upload "to somewhere" on a public server, even not as shadow copy !!!! If you want to use parts of the data in the public, of course you must delete all references to me, Rolf Hemmerling, the online provider, from the data and replace it by your own online provider data !!!!!
